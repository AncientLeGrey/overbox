# Overbox

Overbox is a virtual ruby and java development environment, based on vagrant and
torquebox.

It provides a ready-to-run CentOS 5.6 vm with provisioning scripts f√ºr torquebox,
jenkins and several other tools.

Run "vagrant add project my_project" and have a look at projects/my_project to gain
a feeling how things work.

To be documented ... ;-)
